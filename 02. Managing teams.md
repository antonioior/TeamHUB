## Chat
When you are removed or leave a group the group chat is removed from your chats and you can only start a personal chat with people with whom you have groups in common and therefore are in your contacts.

In the chats it is possible to see if someone has viewed the messages, in the case of the group the double ticks are displayed only when everyone has viewed the message, and in the personal one only if the person involved has viewed it

## Old member
If a member leaves the team or is removed, their profile picture will no longer be visible and their name, if it were to be changed in their personal profile, will not be updated.
In places where a trace of the member remains, particularly in comments, chat, and histories, the profile picture will be displayed grayed out and the last fullname the member had before leaving the team will be kept.
